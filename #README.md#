##Course Description

Learn what to do (and what not to do) when it comes to the command line in this brief, but informative, evening workshop!

This course requires a Linux or Mac computer. You cannot take this class with a Windows computer.

Together, we'll gain new knowledge and skills while we squash the mysteries of the command line!

The command line is a powerful yet oft avoided tool for beginning developers. If you often find yourself Googling how to use the terminal, or what strange commands mean, then this course might be for you!

Specifically, this course will cover basics of directory and file traversal, finding and searching for files and content, and using many of the powerful tools that come along with most Unix Shells. If we're being totally honest, this is an intro to Unix, but it's from the angle of 'getting things done' rather than technical depth or purity.

This is an introductory-level course that gives a broad, basic overview of commonly use commands in Unix. If you have never worked with the command line, or you have limited experience with the command line, this class is for you.

You'll need a Unix compatible system at your disposal, which means a Mac or Linux laptop. If you insist on attempting to attend this course with a windows laptop you can use the terminal window in cloud9, thats http://c9.io
